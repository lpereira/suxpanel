SuxPanel 0.4
--------------

SuxPanel provides a simple and easy to use panel that sits atop your
screen, that lets you:

	- Start your programs
	- Switch between them
	- Control your sound card's volume
	- Organize and manage your virtual desktops
	- Manage your clipboard
	- See the time and date and pop up a calendar
	- And probably more ;)

It's currently meant only for those who don't care about editing
configuration files by hand. :)


New in this Release
-------------------

showdesktop:
	This applet allows you to hide application windows and show the
	desktop.

rox-swallow:
	This plugin allows the usage of ROX Panel applets under SuxPanel; 
	I wrote it initially to use the SystemTray applet available at:

		http://home.comcast.net/~andyhanton/software

	But someone wrote a native plugin, available at:

		http://www.hardline.org

	I'm not including it yet as it's split in multiple files, and it
	would break my current lazy Makefile. ;)


	Anyway, to use this plugin, you'll need to pass an argument to it:
	the path to the ROX applet's AppletRun executable; see the bottom
	of this file for more information on passing parameters to plugins.

mount:
	This plugins allows you mount/umount mountpoints and execute a
	command on success.

	Written by Jens Askengren (jensus@linux.nu).

mail:
	Displays your mailbox (/var/spool/...) status.
